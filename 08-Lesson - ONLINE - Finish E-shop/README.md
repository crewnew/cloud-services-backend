# Lesson 8 - ONLINE

Mention @kaspar#4586 in your #shop-name channel and I will virtually help you between class hours.

Mark yourself OK in the spreadsheet!

Show off latest at the end of the day [working e-shop](../07-Lesson%20-%20E-shop/README.md) to get the grade! How to demo? Short screen recorder for example with Chromium extension https://scre.io but feel free to use whatever screen recorder. Imagine you are demoing now this to your customer not to the teacher so do not use words like subscriptions, GraphQL etc. I see the repo anyway. It must cover everything: front-end and admin panel. I want you to learn, remember and use the full cycle in the future:

1. Speak to the customer to see the needs and write down the user stories (we learned in the very beginning of the course)
2. Draw wireframes according to the user stories (Whimsical much quicker than Figma/XD that are advanced designing softwares. And customers can also use easily Whimsical. You can also use pen and paper and then take a photo but then you need to re-draw too much every time things change and as Uncle Bob said: "You want your software to change - that's why it is a SOFTware")
3. Create ER diagrams according to the Whimsical (guys, I hope you all learned that you shall never skip this phase - again pen and paper will do but well - not the best practice)
4. Create the tables and relations (always to it in the weaker side of the software if you use multiple softwaresâ€¦ eg. in our case Directus)
5. Code the front-end and possible needed back-end that doesn't come out of the box with API engine

Once the course is over feel free to contact me if you want some real customers to build your portfolio!
