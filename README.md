# Cloud-Services Backend

Everybody, please do this: https://forms.gle/dvwovgniCkCScwKP6â€‹ and once added to the repo, please create a branch with your first name. If it is taken then firstname.s (surname initial).â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

FYI on Fridays and Saturdays I deal with your course, usually study myself on Sun and Mon-Thu busy with my other projects so if you have homework then it is better for you to do it on Friday after the class (half of the weeks I go on Friday back to Tartu and can deal in the train/car/etc. And half of the Saturdays if I stay in Tallinn for Friday nightðŸŽ‰)
