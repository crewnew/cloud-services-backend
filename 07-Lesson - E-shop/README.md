# Lesson 7

Finish your e-shop. If you can't finish it then finish it by next time. It must have a fully working admin panel, some sample data in it and the front-end:

1. Products and categories
2. Can add products to cart
3. Login/register & Checkout and buy (simple checkout page displaying IBAN to make the payment is fine)
