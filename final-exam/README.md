# Final Exam

It will be given live one by one to avoid GPT/Google on all answers but on live-coding session it will be allowed. It will be performed exactly like we do it for devs who apply for a work and pretty many companies do that, too. Well, at least ones where you want to work because in such companies you'll be growing fast and will become quicker junior/mid, mid, mid/senior, senior, lead, etc. I won't make it easy as I will do it as I would want to hire you so I will pick 1-3 best to move on to discuss who to hire with the rest of the imaginary team. Those will get A+ or 5+ (nore sure about your grading but max). Then I will imagine that we have a little less paying role for little less experience and those 1-3 will get A or 5 etc.

To guarantee yourself A+/5+ without the exam, you must take the extra step and learn something fancy and new. I'm not talking about Hasura, GraphQL, Postgres, Directus, N8N or any other stuff you must know anyway but somethig other. I can give some suggestions: Build a cool SPA or even better PWA app with some modern front-end framework eg. [Svelte]() & [SvelteKit]() - easiest, fastest, coolest, etc compared to React, Vue or Angular. Or if not SPA then some other advanced stuff: integrate Oauth and Stripe payment for example with your app. Feel free to suggest some other extra fancy cool stack/stuff to build.
