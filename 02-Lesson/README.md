### 2. Let's meet each other & questions from last lesson
Questions Kaspar will tell and you will answer verbally. Later you edit this file and add your question/answer as a separate file under `/answers`.

### 3. Let's make a query from the internet

So, what's the point of the API? You give the endpoint and the API password to someone or make youerself a query from your app. 

I build SvelteKit apps, I think you do React/Next some and use vanialla JS? PHP? Anyway with JS you can just use ´fetch()´. But we can try it out with [Thunder Client for VSC](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client), [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground) or similar. Sometimes some things don't work as you know and then it's good to have multiple tools in your toolbox. Eg. for this Hasura instance the docs doesn't work: https://i.imgur.com/zNGcYO0.png Some some web tools for your toolbox, too: https://reqbin.com (I like it for it's speed and no login needed) and https://www.postman.com/ (I like it because it has a huge amount of readymade requests for the popular different APIs and you can invite others to collaborate on queries).

History and saving queries in the repo ´.gql´ format.
