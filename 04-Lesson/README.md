## Remote schemas

Now you have learned how powerful it is to query everything you have via GraphQL and you have also learned that you can access all that from anywhere. From your app, any other app, everywhere. 

How cool not would be if you could also have in the same way in your GraphQL schema for example all your [Shopify](https://hasura.io/hub/shopify-graphql-admin-api/) or [Magento](https://hasura.io/hub/adobe-commerce-magento-graphql-api/) e-shop, [all your GitHub repos, projects, issues, etc,](https://hasura.io/hub/github-graphql-api/), or get weather info (current, past and predictions) via [OpenWeather](https://hasura.io/hub/openweather-graphql/), manager your [CMS](https://hasura.io/hub/?category=cms) - let it be Directus, Wordpress or any other.

[GraphQL Mesh](https://hasura.io/hub/graphql-mesh-api/) lets you use GraphQL to access data in remote APIs. Learn how to create a Data Graph with GraphQL Mesh & Hasura Remote Joins.

Literally connect **any** API (GraphQL or REST or OpenAPI/Swagger) to your single source of truth just next your other data. Your API consumers can access everything they need from one place. That is the whole point. And if they don't have API then we can connect to them using PosthreSQL, MySQL, MSSql, and many more databases.
