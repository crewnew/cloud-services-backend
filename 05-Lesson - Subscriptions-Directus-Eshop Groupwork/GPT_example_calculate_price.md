To create a computed field in Hasura for `product.price`, you can follow these steps:

1.  Create a custom SQL function in your PostgreSQL database that calculates the product price based on the given conditions.
2.  Expose the custom SQL function as a computed field in Hasura using the Hasura Console or the metadata API.

Here's the SQL function you can create in your PostgreSQL database:

sql

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_product_price(p_own_price NUMERIC)
RETURNS NUMERIC AS $$
BEGIN
    IF p_own_price < 500 THEN
        RETURN p_own_price * 1.5;
    ELSE
        RETURN p_own_price * 1.4;
    END IF;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

After creating the function, you can add a computed field in Hasura to your `product` table. You can do this using the Hasura Console or by updating your Hasura metadata.

Here's an example of how to add the computed field using the metadata API. Add the following configuration to the `computed_fields` section of your `product` table in the Hasura metadata file:

yaml

```yaml
- name: price
  function:
    schema: public
    name: calculate_product_price
  table_argument: own_price
```

This configuration will create a computed field called `price` in the `product` table, which calls the `calculate_product_price` function with the `own_price` column as an argument.

Now, when you query the `product` table in Hasura, you can include the `price` field in your selection set, and Hasura will automatically call the custom function to compute the price based on the `own_price` value.

1 / 1

I apologize for the confusion. In this case, let's create a new SQL function that accepts a row from the `product` table as an argument and returns a single value. Here's an updated version of the SQL function:

sql

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_product_price(p product)
RETURNS NUMERIC AS $$
BEGIN
    IF p.own_price < 500 THEN
        RETURN p.own_price * 1.5;
    ELSE
        RETURN p.own_price * 1.4;
    END IF;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

Make sure you replace the `product` in the function argument `p product` with the appropriate name of your `product` table if it's different.

After creating this function, head to the Hasura console and follow these steps to add the computed field:

1.  Go to the "Data" tab and click on your `product` table.
2.  Click on the "Modify" tab, then scroll down to the "Computed fields" section.
3.  Click on the "+ Add" button next to "Computed fields".
4.  Enter "price" as the "Computed field name".
5.  In the "Function name" dropdown, select the `calculate_product_price` function that you've just created.
6.  Set the "Table row argument" to `product_row` or any other name that matches the name you used in the function definition.
7.  Click the "Save" button.

Now, you should be able to query the `product` table in Hasura, including the `price` field in your selection set, and Hasura will automatically call the custom function to compute the price based on the `own_price` value.

Apologies for the confusion. It seems that the type `product` does not exist in your PostgreSQL database. In that case, you can create a new SQL function using a different approach. Instead of passing a row of the `product` table as an argument, you can pass the `own_price` column as a single argument. Here's an updated version of the SQL function:

sql

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_product_price(p_own_price NUMERIC)
RETURNS NUMERIC AS $$
BEGIN
    IF p_own_price < 500 THEN
        RETURN p_own_price * 1.5;
    ELSE
        RETURN p_own_price * 1.4;
    END IF;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql STABLE;
```

After creating this function, head to the Hasura console and follow these steps to add the computed field:

1.  Go to the "Data" tab and click on your `product` table.
2.  Click on the "Modify" tab, then scroll down to the "Computed fields" section.
3.  Click on the "+ Add" button next to "Computed fields".
4.  Enter "price" as the "Computed field name".
5.  In the "Function name" dropdown, select the `calculate_product_price` function that you've just created.
6.  Set the "Table row argument" to `own_price` or any other name that matches the name you used in the function definition.
7.  Click the "Save" button.

Now, you should be able to query the `product` table in Hasura, including the `price` field in your selection set, and Hasura will automatically call the custom function to compute the price based on the `own_price` value.

I apologize for the confusion. It seems the function is not being recognized as a valid computed field function. In this case, let's try a different approach by creating a scalar function instead of a table function.

Here's an updated version of the SQL function:

sql

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_product_price(p_own_price NUMERIC)
RETURNS NUMERIC AS $$
BEGIN
    IF p_own_price < 500 THEN
        RETURN p_own_price * 1.5;
    ELSE
        RETURN p_own_price * 1.4;
    END IF;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql STABLE;
```

To create the computed field, you can use the Hasura metadata API to add the function to the `computed_fields` section of the `product` table. Here's an example configuration:

yaml

```yaml
- name: price
  function:
    schema: public
    name: calculate_product_price
  table_argument: own_price
```

If you prefer using the Hasura Console, try refreshing the console after creating the function. If the function still doesn't appear, you can add the computed field manually by modifying the Hasura metadata.

1.  Navigate to the "Settings" tab on your Hasura Console.
2.  Click on "Export metadata" and save the YAML file to your local machine.
3.  Open the YAML file and locate the `product` table configuration.
4.  Add the following configuration under the `computed_fields` section:

yaml

```yaml
- name: price
  function:
    schema: public
    name: calculate_product_price
  table_argument: own_price
```

5.  Save the changes and head back to the Hasura Console.
6.  Navigate to the "Settings" tab and click on "Clear & Import metadata".
7.  Choose the modified YAML file you saved earlier and click "Import".

Now, you should be able to query the `product` table in Hasura, including the `price` field in your selection set, and Hasura will automatically call the custom function to compute the price based on the `own_price` value.

> No options to pick from dropdown again. I think we should also define that "own\_price" field used in calculations should come from "products" table?

My apologies for the confusion. I understand the issue now. Let's create a function that accepts the `products` table's primary key as a parameter and then performs the calculation using the `own_price` field. First, ensure you replace `products` and `product_id` with the actual table name and primary key column name if they are different in your schema.

sql

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_product_price(p_id INTEGER)
RETURNS NUMERIC AS $$
DECLARE
    own_price NUMERIC;
BEGIN
    SELECT products.own_price INTO own_price FROM products WHERE products.product_id = p_id;

    IF own_price < 500 THEN
        RETURN own_price * 1.5;
    ELSE
        RETURN own_price * 1.4;
    END IF;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql STABLE;
```

After creating this function, head to the Hasura console and follow these steps to add the computed field:

1.  Go to the "Data" tab and click on your `products` table.
2.  Click on the "Modify" tab, then scroll down to the "Computed fields" section.
3.  Click on the "+ Add" button next to "Computed fields".
4.  Enter "price" as the "Computed field name".
5.  In the "Function name" dropdown, select the `calculate_product_price` function that you've just created.
6.  Set the "Table row argument" to `product_id` or any other name that matches the name you used in the function definition.
7.  Click the "Save" button.

Now, you should be able to query the `products` table in Hasura, including the `price` field in your selection set, and Hasura will automatically call the custom function to compute the price based on the `own_price` value.

I apologize for the inconvenience. I believe I have identified the issue: Hasura only supports table functions (also known as set-returning functions) for computed fields. In this case, we need to return a table with one row and one column containing the computed price.

Here's the updated SQL function:

sql

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_product_price(p_id INTEGER)
RETURNS TABLE (price NUMERIC) AS $$
DECLARE
    own_price NUMERIC;
BEGIN
    SELECT products.own_price INTO own_price FROM products WHERE products.product_id = p_id;

    IF own_price < 500 THEN
        price := own_price * 1.5;
    ELSE
        price := own_price * 1.4;
    END IF;
    RETURN NEXT;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql STABLE;
```

After creating this function, head to the Hasura console and follow these steps to add the computed field:

1.  Go to the "Data" tab and click on your `products` table.
2.  Click on the "Modify" tab, then scroll down to the "Computed fields" section.
3.  Click on the "+ Add" button next to "Computed fields".
4.  Enter "price" as the "Computed field name".
5.  In the "Function name" dropdown, select the `calculate_product_price` function that you've just created.
6.  Set the "Table row argument" to `product_id` or any other name that matches the name you used in the function definition.
7.  Click the "Save" button.

Now, you should be able to query the `products` table in Hasura, including the `price` field in your selection set, and Hasura will automatically call the custom function to compute the price based on the `own_price` value.

I apologize for the confusion. The error is caused by the fact that the return type of the existing function is different from the new one we're trying to create. You need to drop the existing function first before creating the new one with the same name.

Here's how to drop the existing function:

sql

```sql
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS calculate_product_price(INTEGER);
```

After executing the above SQL command to drop the existing function, create the new function again using the updated SQL function definition:

sql

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_product_price(p_id INTEGER)
RETURNS TABLE (price NUMERIC) AS $$
DECLARE
    own_price NUMERIC;
BEGIN
    SELECT products.own_price INTO own_price FROM products WHERE products.product_id = p_id;

    IF own_price < 500 THEN
        price := own_price * 1.5;
    ELSE
        price := own_price * 1.4;
    END IF;
    RETURN NEXT;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql STABLE;
```

Now, you should be able to add the computed field in the Hasura console as described in the previous response.

I apologize for the issues you are facing. I have thoroughly reviewed the problem, and I am providing you with a solution that should work for you. We will create a trigger function that calculates the price and stores it in a new column whenever a row is inserted or updated in the `products` table.

First, let's add a new column to the `products` table called `price`. You can do this using the Hasura Console or by executing the following SQL command:

sql

```sql
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN price NUMERIC;
```

Next, create the trigger function:

sql

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_product_price()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    IF NEW.own_price < 500 THEN
        NEW.price := NEW.own_price * 1.5;
    ELSE
        NEW.price := NEW.own_price * 1.4;
    END IF;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

Now, create a trigger that calls the `calculate_product_price` function before inserting or updating a row in the `products` table:

sql

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER update_product_price
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON products
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION calculate_product_price();
```

With this trigger in place, whenever you insert or update a row in the `products` table, the `price` column will be automatically calculated and stored based on the `own_price` value. You can then query the `price` column directly when fetching data from the `products` table, without needing to create a computed field in Hasura.

Please note that this solution requires the `price` column to be stored in the database, which might have a small impact on storage usage. However, it should resolve the issue you are facing with the computed field.
